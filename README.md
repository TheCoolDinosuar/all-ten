# All Ten
Art of Problem Solving has this game called All Ten. Each day, a new puzzle is
released. Using the 4 given digits and the operations
- addition,
- subtraction,
- multiplication,
- division, and
- concatentation,

the goal is to create each number from 1 to 10. The only caveat is that
concatenation cannot be used in intermediate calculations, you can only
concatenate the original digits together.

You can play the game [here](https://beastacademy.com/all-ten).
